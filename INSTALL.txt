
Install instructions
====================

you need to either install Java JRE, JDK version 8 or Higher or use Arduino's IDE 1.87 
which ALREADY contains Java 8 JRE

Windows 64-bit
==============

If you are using Arduino IDE's Java skip ahead to Windows GUIsliceBuilder Install.

To download Java 8 you can use Oracle's JRE.  Yo may also simply download the latest 
version of OpenJDK from the https://openjdk.java.net/ site.

Oracle's latest version is 221 and the site is:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

You then need to run the downloaded file:
jre-8u192-windows-x64.exe

Windows GUIsliceBuilder Installer
=================================
Download the Builder from github

Then run builder-win64-1.0.exe

LINUX
=====

During installation You need to identify what directory has the Java JRE.  

For Arduino's IDE Java it is inside your current arduino IDE directory
for example:
$HOME/arduino-1.8.7/java

If you are not using Arduino's Java you first need to test to see if Java
is installed.

You can test to determine if you have Java installed by
opening a terminal and typing
$ java -version

If its not installed you will see something like the following output:

Command 'java' not found, but can be installed with:

apt install default-jre
apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
apt install openjdk-9-jre-headless

Then to install the default version enter:
$ sudo apt install default-jre

and test with:
$ java -version

Once you have confirmed that Java is installed you need the path to Java for running
the GUIsliceBuilder install script.
You can find the full set of installed versions by using this command.

sudo update-alternatives --config java

Example output:
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                            Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java      1101      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java   1081      manual mode


Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number:

After Identifying the correct location of java you can enter the path
during the run of install.sh script.  Note you DO NOT use the "/bin/java"
piece of the path. So to use java 11 you would type in 
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/jre

If you are using Arduino IDE's skip to LINUX GUIsliceBuilder SETUP.

LINUX GUIsliceBuilder SETUP
===========================

Download and untar builder-win64-1.0.tar.gz into your home directory.
Open a terminal
cd $HOME
tar xvzf builder-linux64-1.0.tar.gz

Then enter the new GUIsliceBuilder folder
cd GUIsliceBuilder

Then run the installer and answer where to find your Java 8 files.

./install.sh

Your GUIsliceBuilder should now be on your Desktop.

LINUX run the Builder
=====================
Clicking on the GUIslice Icon on your Desktop will open the builder.
You can also run the builder by: 
./GUIslice.sh
